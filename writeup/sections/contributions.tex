\noindent\textbf{Brandon Szeto} implemented the data loading functionality, developed the tokenizer, and constructed the baseline model. His work on data preprocessing and model architecture greatly contributed to the development of the project. In addition, he wrote the abstract, introduction, and related works section of the write up.

\noindent\textbf{Darren Yu} implemented additional argument flags for each model (baseline, custom, supcon) to ensure results were being saved. He engaged in pair programming sessions with Nathaniel, actively participating as the driver. He also contributed significantly to the visualization aspect of the project by developing all plotting code. Darren wrote the discussion and helped proofread the paper.

\noindent\textbf{Nathaniel} implemented the training code, incorporating the supervised contrastive loss model. He worked with Darren to develop the models using SupCon and SimCLR loss. He also worked with Brandon to develop the fine-tuned models after the implementation of the baseline. He helped write the methods and results of the write up.
