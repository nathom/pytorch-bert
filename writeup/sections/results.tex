\section*{Results}

Summarize and document the results for all experiments (Baseline Model, Custom Finetuning Strategies, SupContrast and SimCLR).

(a) Include the table(s) (for the 6 experiments as indicated above with “exp idx”)

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|l|l|l|}
        \hline
        Exp. Index & Experiment & Loss & Accuracy \\
        \hline
        1 & Test set before fine-tuning    && \\
        \hline
        2 & Test set after fine-tuning     && \\
        \hline
        3 & Test set with first technique  && \\
        \hline
        4 & Test set with second technique && \\
        \hline
        5 & Test set with two techniques   && \\
        \hline
        6 & Test set with SupContrast      && \\
        \hline
        7 & Test set with SimCLR           && \\

(b) Provide your training and validation accuracy in each plot for the following 5 models

i. Baseline model

ii. first fine-tuning technique

iii. second fine-tuning technique 

iv. SupContrast

v. SimCLR
